\begin{abstract} 
{\bf Discovering the effects of code style on code functionality and problem
structure.} This study aims to showcase how well formatted, reusable and
maintainable code is fundamentally better in all circumstances by
looking at over 1 million results from a competitive programming website
and analyzing the correlation between question and solution. The goal is
to promote code quality checking in online `just in time' teaching
resources to improve the performance of interviewers, researchers, and
students. \end{abstract} 


\section{Description of Applied
Problem}\label{description-of-applied-problem}

\subsection{Problem}\label{problem}

A large amount of educational material related to programming exists on
the internet but the majority of which is not well structured or
presented. An applied problem that can be observed from educational
material found online is that code quality is often left mutually
exclusive from code functionality. \citet{justintimeteaching}

This leads to some students believing it is acceptable to write code
that produces the correct result even if the process behind it is not
correct. Online code challenge websites like CodeChef.com do not take
into account the style and quality metrics of a code submission when
judging competitions. \citet{codechef} Cutting corners in the learning
process advances into a complete disregard for best practices in open
source software and in the workplace which results in a larger amount of
errors. Readability of code is an essential metric in software
engineering and can be improved even with simple additions of whitespace
between lines. \citet{codereadability}

Computer code written by researchers and other individuals who are just
trying to accomplish a result in any way possible is often of the worse
quality. This is because they learn using the `just in time' mentality
and the resources online that promote this mentality disregard code
quality. \citet{justintimeteaching} Lack of code quality directly
reduces it's re-usability because other programmers have a harder time
understanding what the code is doing. If these teaching resources could
use questions and checks that promote better code quality, many
technical innovations could be made. Researchers would be more educated
on how to create reusable code and this would influence developers to
take their ideas and apply them to real life use cases.
\citet{reusability}

Code quality post processing software is often used in production
development environments to ensure good style choices. These checks are
much less useful at this senior level than they would be at an
educational level. If programming style can be judged on a submission,
companies conducting technical interviews will be able to better judge
applicants and make a more informed decision.

This study will focus on proving that code quality can have an influence
on code functionality, as well as which kinds of questions influence
good or bad code styles.

\subsection{Proposed Solution}\label{proposed-solution}

A solution to these problems is linking the scoring process in
programming problems to a metric derived from running code quality
checks on the submission.

Not only will this analysis benefit educational institutes but also
companies and competitions that judge people on their code submissions.

\section{Description of Available
Data}\label{description-of-available-data}

\subsection{CodeChef Dataset}\label{codechef-dataset}

CodeChef.com is a competitive programming web application that has
posted all of their questions and solutions onto the data science
website, Kaggle. The data consists of a questions comma separated file,
a solutions comma separated file and 3 files that show the code
associated with each solution id. The set contains about 1000 problem
statements and over 1 million code solutions submitted. This should be a
more than sufficient to make a training and test data set.

The important features available for each question are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  title
\item
  link
\item
  difficulty level
\item
  question statement
\item
  time limit
\end{itemize}

The important features available for each solution are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  status (correct or wrong)
\item
  time taken
\item
  memory taken
\item
  language written in
\item
  solution url
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Filtering by popular
languages}\label{filtering-by-popular-languages}

The code submissions are written in many different programming languages
and each language has it's own code analysis tool. Therefore, to make
the process simpler and come up with higher quality results, the data
will need to be filtered by the top languages used.
Figure\textasciitilde{}\ref{languages} shows that C++, Java, C and
Python are the most popular submissions in this dataset. There are 4
versions of C++ but it should be possible to process them with one tool.

\section{Plan for Analysis and
Visualization}\label{plan-for-analysis-and-visualization}

\subsection{Description}\label{description}

In order to make the connection between code functionality and code
style, a large part of the experiment is obtaining a accurate and
unbiased metric for code quality. Since different tools produce
different metrics, a way to normalize the results into a comparable
format will need to be discovered. Some options for code quality tools
are: CMetrics, cpplint, CScout, Findbugs, ckjm, pydocstring, xenon and
pylint. Once a code quality metric is associated with each solution, I
will aim to discover the correlation between that metric and the
difficulty level stated on CodeChef. From those statistics I could use
correlation matrices as visualizations to show how accurate the CodeChef
difficulty level is.

\subsection{NLP on Questions}\label{nlp-on-questions}

Another possible analysis could be made by processing the question
statements using natural language processing and see what kinds of
statements are associated with good code style and what kinds of
statements result in more failures. \citet{kernalnlp}

\subsection{Code Equivalence}\label{code-equivalence}

Using some set code metric number that divides the solution set into
two, high quality and low quality, we can test to find a common
structure within these submissions to pin point where most contestants
are running into quality problems. \citet{kernalequival}

Once a set of common structures are defined, this could also be tied
back in to the NLP data we aggregated to discover trends showing what
question types produce each structure of code. The end result could be
visualized with a classifier, classifying questions into solution
structure categories.

\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}

From this analysis we should be able to conclude how much of an impact
good code style has on achieving high functionality and how different
question types might skew the chances of high quality or low quality
code.
