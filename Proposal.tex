\section{Description of Applied
Problem}\label{description-of-applied-problem}

\subsection{Problem}\label{problem}

A large amount of educational material related to programming exists on
the internet but the majority of which is not well structured or
presented. An applied problem that can be observed from educational
material found online is that code quality is often left mutually
exclusive from code functionality. This leads to some readers believing
it is acceptable to write code that produces the correct result even if
the process behind it is not correct. Online code challenge websites
like CodeChef.com do not take into account the style and quality metrics
of a code submission when judging competitions. Cutting corners in the
learning process advances into a complete disregard for best practices
in open source software and in the workplace which results in a larger
amount of errors. (site bad code quality = errors)

Code quality post processing software is often used in production
development environments to ensure good style choices. These checks are
much less useful at this senior level than they would be at an
educational level. If programming style can be judged on a submission,
companies conducting technical interviews will be able to better judge
applicants and make a more informed decision.

This study will focus on proving that code quality can have an influence
on code functionality, as well as which kinds of questions influence
good or bad code styles.

\subsection{Proposed Solution}\label{proposed-solution}

A solution to these problems is linking the scoring process in
programming problems to a metric derived from running code quality
checks on the submission.

Not only will this analysis benefit educational institutes but also
companies and competitions that judge people on their code submissions.

\section{Description of Available
Data}\label{description-of-available-data}

\subsection{CodeChef Dataset}\label{codechef-dataset}

CodeChef.com is a competitive programming web application that has
posted all of their questions and solutions onto the data science
website, Kaggle. The data consists of a questions comma separated file,
a solutions comma separated file and 3 files that show the code
associated with each solution id. The set contains about 1000 problem
statements and over 1 million code solutions submitted. This should be a
more than sufficient to make a training and test data set.

The important features available for each question are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  title
\item
  link
\item
  difficulty level
\item
  question statement
\item
  time limit
\end{itemize}

The important features available for each solution are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  status (correct or wrong)
\item
  time taken
\item
  memory taken
\item
  language written in
\item
  solution url
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Filtering by popular
languages}\label{filtering-by-popular-languages}

The code submissions are written in many different programming languages
and each language has it's own code analysis tool. Therefore, to make
the process simpler and come up with higher quality results, the data
will need to be filtered by the top languages used. Figure 1 shows that
C++, Java, C and Python are the most popular submissions in this
dataset. There are 4 versions of C++ but it should be possible to
process them with one tool.
