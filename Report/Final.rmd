boldabstract: Discovering the effects of code style on code functionality and problem structure.
abstract: This study aims to showcase how well formatted, reusable and maintainable code is fundamentally better in all circumstances by looking at over 1 million results from a competitive programming website and analyzing the correlation between question and solution. The goal is to promote code quality checking in online 'just in time' teaching resources to improve the performance of interviewers, researchers, and students.

# Description of Applied Problem

## Problem identification

A large amount of educational material related to programming exists on the
internet but the majority of which is not well structured or presented. An
applied problem that can be observed from educational material found online is
that code quality is often left mutually exclusive from code functionality.
@justintimeteaching

This leads to some students believing it is acceptable to write code that
produces the correct result even if the process behind it is not correct.
Online code challenge websites like CodeChef.com do not take into account the
style and quality metrics of a code submission when judging competitions.
@codechef Cutting corners in the learning process advances into a complete
disregard for best practices in open source software and in the workplace which
results in a larger amount of errors. Readability of code is an essential
metric in software engineering and can be improved even with simple additions
of whitespace between lines. @codereadability

Computer code written by researchers and other individuals who are just trying
to accomplish a result in any way possible is often of the worse quality. This
is because they learn using the 'just in time' mentality and the resources
online that promote this mentality disregard code quality. @justintimeteaching
Lack of code quality directly reduces it's re-usability because other
programmers have a harder time understanding what the code is doing. If these
teaching resources could use questions and checks that promote better code
quality, many technical innovations could be made. Researchers would be more
educated on how to create reusable code and this would influence developers to
take their ideas and apply them to real life use cases. @reusability

Code quality post processing software is often used in production development
environments to ensure good style choices. These checks are much less useful at
this senior level than they would be at an educational level. If programming
style can be judged on a submission, companies conducting technical interviews
will be able to better judge applicants and make a more informed decision. 

This study will focus on proving that code quality can have an influence on
code functionality, as well as which kinds of questions influence good or bad
code styles.

## Approach Strategy

A solution to these problems is linking the scoring process in programming
problems to a metric derived from running code quality checks on the
submission.

Not only will this analysis benefit educational institutes but also companies
and competitions that judge people on their code submissions. 

# Data Description

## CodeChef Dataset

CodeChef.com is a competitive programming web application that has posted all
of their questions and solutions onto the data science website, Kaggle. The
data consists of a questions comma separated file, a solutions comma separated
file and 3 files that show the code associated with each solution id. The set
contains about 1000 problem statements and over 1 million code solutions
submitted. This should be a more than sufficient to make a training and test
data set. 

## Code Submission Language Density

The code submissions are written in many different programming languages and
each language has it's own code analysis tool. Therefore, to make the process
simpler and come up with higher quality results, the data will need to be
filtered by the top languages used. Figure~\ref{languages} shows that C++,
Java, C and Python are the most popular submissions in this dataset. The 
majority of the dataset is describing submissions in the C family of languages.
They are also the easiest to group together and process allowing for fair 
comparison of results, therefore, this study will focus only on the C family.

## Feature Selection

### Question Data

The most useful features in the question data files are title, link, difficulty
level, question statement, and time limit

### Solution Data 

The most useful features in the solution data files are status, time taken,
memory taken, and language

### Code Data

The code data files only contain two columns, the first one containing the
solution ID and the second containing the code string. The solution ID will be
used to merge the data with the solution data file and that data frame will act
as the base for the rest of the analysis on code.

In order to make the connection between code functionality and code style, a
large part of the experiment is obtaining an accurate and unbiased metric for
code quality. The decision to narrow the dataset to only the C family shows
it's importance here as we can use a single tool to evaluate quality

The tool we will be using is `cpplint`. It is open source and follows [Google's
C style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)
